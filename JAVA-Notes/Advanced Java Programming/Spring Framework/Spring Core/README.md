Welcome to my Spring Core deep-dive! I am a **BCA Student** using this repository to document my journey through the **Spring Framework**. On a mission to master the art of building scalable enterprise applications. This repository serves as my digital garden—a place where I document my progress, reflect on core concepts, and archive my notes.

### 🤓☝️ As a student, I believe that 
> **"documentation is the highest form of understanding"**

## 🎯 The Mission

The goal of this repository is to track my evolution from a Spring novice to a proficient developer. I am focusing on **Spring Core** to build a rock-solid foundation before moving into **Spring Boot** and **Microservices.**

I created this repository to:

1. **Reinforce Learning:** Writing down what I learn forces me to clarify my thoughts.
2. **Track Progress:** A tangible history of concepts I’ve mastered over time.
3. **Build a Reference:** A personalized guide I can look back on when I face challenges in the future.

## 🌱 Why I’m Doing This Publicly

- To stay **consistent** — public commitment > private promises  
- To create the best possible **revision notes** for myself  
- To show future recruiters / mentors / myself → **"I really worked hard on this"**  
- To practice explaining concepts clearly (teaching = deepest learning)

## 🗺️ Learning Roadmap & Progress
| Topic | Status | Key Takeaway |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Introduction to Spring** | ✅ | Understanding the ecosystem and the "Spring Way." |
| **Inversion of Control (IoC)** | 🔄 | Decoupling object creation from execution. |
| **Dependency Injection (DI)** | 🔄 | Constructor vs. Setter injection. |
| **Spring Bean Lifecycle** | ⏳ | Init, Destroy, and Post-Processors. |
| **Annotation-based Config** | ⏳ | Moving away from XML to `@Component` and `@Autowired`. |
| **Spring Expression Language (SpEL)** | ⏳ | Dynamic evaluation of expressions. |

## 🧑‍💻 My Approach
I am following a "Learn by Breaking" methodology:

* **Concept:** Read the official docs and watch tutorials.
* **Code:** Write a small, isolated example to see it in action.
* **Break:** Intentionally break the code to understand the error messages.
* **Document:** Push the working code and write a summary in this repo.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

* **Language:** Java (JDK 17+)
* **Build Tool:** Maven
* **Framework:** Spring Framework (Core Modules)
* **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse

## 🤝 How to Follow My Progress

Star ⭐ this repo if you're also learning Spring — let's motivate each other!  
Feel free to open issues / discussions if:

- You spot a mistake (I'm still learning!)
- You have a better way to explain something
- You want to suggest a good practice / mini-project

Let's grow together! 🚀

## 👋 Connect & Collaborate
