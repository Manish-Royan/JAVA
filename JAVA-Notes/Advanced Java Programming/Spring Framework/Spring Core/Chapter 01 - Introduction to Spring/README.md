# 🍃 Introduction to Spring Core Framework

## **1. What is Spring?**

➡️ Spring is a lightweight, open-source framework for building enterprise-grade Java applications. It provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model that simplifies development by handling infrastructure concerns, so developers can focus on business logic.

➡️ At its heart, Spring is about:
* **Inversion of Control (IoC)** → Framework manages object creation and wiring.
* **Dependency Injection (DI)** → Dependencies are injected rather than hard-coded.
* **Modularity** → Different modules for different needs (Core, AOP, Data, Security, etc.).

### 👉 Think of Spring as a toolbox for enterprise Java: you pick the tools you need, without being forced into heavyweight solutions.
