## What does URI can identify a physical object‚ùì
‚û°Ô∏è When we say a URI can identify a **physical object**, it means the URI acts as a unique, standardized name for that object in the digital world, even though the object itself exists in the physical world.

‚û°Ô∏è The URI isn't the object, nor does it mean the object is "on the internet." It's a **label** that computer systems can use to refer to that specific object without ambiguity.

## üëÄ Let's look at some real-world examples.

### üìå Example 1: A Book (The Classic Example)

*   **The Physical Object:** A printed copy of the book "The Lord of the Rings".
*   **The Identifier:** This book has an ISBN (International Standard Book Number), let's say `978-0-618-64015-7`.
*   **The URI Representation:** This ISBN can be represented as a URN (a type of URI) like this:
    `urn:isbn:978-0-618-64015-7`

**What does this mean?**
This URI uniquely identifies that specific edition of that book. A library's computer system, a bookstore's inventory, or a book cataloging website can use this URI as the official "name" for the book. When two computer systems exchange information about this book, they can use this URI to be absolutely sure they are talking about the same thing. The URI points to the *concept* of the book, which is represented by the physical object.

### üìå Example 2: A Product in a Supermarket

*   **The Physical Object:** A can of Campbell's Tomato Soup.
*   **The Identifier:** The barcode on the can, which represents a UPC (Universal Product Code), for example, `051000000116`.
*   **The URI Representation:** This could be represented as:
    `urn:gtin:051000000116` (GTIN is the global standard that includes UPCs).

**What does this mean?**
When a cashier scans the barcode, the point-of-sale system uses that identifier (the URI) to look up information in its database: the product name, the price, and to deduct one can from the inventory. The URI acts as the primary key that links the physical can in your hand to its corresponding data record in the store's system.

### üìå Example 3: A Smart Device (Internet of Things)

*   **The Physical Object:** A specific smart temperature sensor in a factory, with the serial number `A4-B1-C9-88-FF-01`.
*   **The Identifier:** Its unique serial number or a UUID (Universally Unique Identifier).
*   **The URI Representation:** This might be represented as:
    `urn:uuid:a4b1c988-ff01-4a5b-824d-1234567890ab`

**What does this mean?**
When this sensor sends a temperature reading to a central server, it includes its unique URI in the message. The server software knows exactly which physical device the data came from. If the sensor needs maintenance, a work order can be generated for the device identified by this URI. It allows you to manage and track individual physical objects at a massive scale.

### üóùÔ∏è Key Takeaway
‚û°Ô∏è A URI for a physical object is a bridge between the physical world and the world of data. It's a **standardized label** that allows software to:

*   **Name** a physical thing uniquely.
*   **Refer** to it without confusion.
*   **Attach** data to it (like price, location, status, or sensor readings).
*   **Manage** it as part of a larger system.
