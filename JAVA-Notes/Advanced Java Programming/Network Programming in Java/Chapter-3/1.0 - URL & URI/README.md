## ‚ùìWhat is a URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
‚û°Ô∏è A **URL** is a specific *type* of URI. Its primary job is not just to identify a resource but also to specify its location and the method (protocol) to access it. It's the web address you type into your browser.

### üî∏A URL contains information like:
*   **Protocol:** `http://`, `https://`, `ftp://`
*   **Hostname:** `www.github.com`
*   **Path:** `/Manish-Bishwakarma`

#### üí≠ **Analogy:** A URL is like a full home address: `123 Main Street, Anytown, USA`. It gives you the exact location and implies a method to get there (e.g., by road).


## ‚ùìWhat is a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)
‚û°Ô∏è A **URI** is a string of characters used to identify a resource. Think of it as a generic ID for anything. This "resource" can be a [physical object](https://github.com/Manish-Royan/JAVA/tree/main/JAVA-Notes/Advanced%20Java%20Programming/Network%20Programming%20in%20Java/Chapter-3/%23%20More%20Depth%20Explorations/1.0%20MDE%20-%20What%20does%20it%20mean%20by%20URI%20Physical%20Object), a document, a web page, or even an abstract concept. The key purpose of a URI is to provide a unique and unambiguous identifier.

### üî∏A URI has two main types:
1.  **Locator (URL):** Tells you where to find something.
2.  **Name (URN):** Just names something uniquely, without telling you its location.

#### üí≠**Analogy:** Suppose your name is, "John Cena". It's a unique identifier (a URN, or Uniform Resource *Name*). It identifies *you*, but it doesn't tell anyone where to find you. The ISBN of a book (e.g., `urn:isbn:0-486-27557-4`) is another perfect example of a URI that is a name, not a location.

## The Difference in General Terms
‚û°Ô∏è The main difference is one of scope: **All URLs are URIs, but not all URIs are URLs.**

*   A **URI** is the overarching concept of identifying something.
*   A **URL** is a more specific kind of URI that also tells you where to find that something.

üí≠ Let's use an analogy:

| Concept | Analogy | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **URI** | The general idea of "a person's identity" | "Manish Bishwakarma" (identifies you, but where are you?) |
| **URL** | A person's full home address | "Manish Bishwakarma, 123 Code Street, Dev City" (tells us exactly where to find you) |

#### üëâ In the digital world:
*   `https://github.com/Manish-Bishwakarma` is both a **URI** (it identifies my profile) and a **URL** (it tells the browser where to locate it).
*   `urn:isbn:978-0321765723` (the ISBN for a book) is a **URI**, but it is *not* a URL because it only names the book; it doesn't tell you where to download or buy it.

### 1. "In the last chapter, we've learned how to address hosts... In this chapter, we increase the granularity by addressing resources..."

*   **Addressing a Host (Low Granularity):** An IP address (`185.199.108.153`) or a hostname (`github.com`) points to a specific computer (a server) on the network.
    *   üí≠**Analogy:** This is like knowing the street address of a large office building: **"123 Main Street."** You know where the building is, but you don't know which office you're looking for inside.

*   **Addressing a Resource (High Granularity):** A single server can host thousands or even millions of individual resources (files, images, videos, data endpoints). You need a way to pinpoint a *specific one*.
    *   üí≠**Analogy:** This is like specifying an office number within that building: **"123 Main Street, Suite 404, File Cabinet B, Folder 'Finances'."** You are now pointing to a very specific resource inside the larger host.

### 2. "HTML is a hypertext markup language because it includes a way to specify links to other documents identified by URLs."
‚û°Ô∏è This part connects the concept to a familiar technology: the web.
*   The power of the web ("hypertext") is its ability to link documents together.
*   How does it do that? By using URLs. When you write `<a href="https://example.com/page2.html">Go to Page 2</a>` in HTML, the `href` attribute contains the URL.
*   This URL is the unambiguous address that tells the browser *exactly* where to find `page2.html` on the internet.

***

### 3. "A URL is the most common type of URI... A URI can identify a resource by its network location... or by its name, number, or other characteristics."
‚û°Ô∏è This restates the core difference we discussed earlier, reinforcing the hierarchy.

*   **URI (The "What"):** The general concept of an identifier.
    *   Example by **Name**: `urn:isbn:978-0321765723` identifies a specific book but doesn't tell you where to find it.
*   **URL (The "Where"):** A specific kind of URI that includes location information.
    *   Example by **Location**: `https://www.example.com/books/effective-java.pdf` not only identifies the book's PDF but also tells your program how to get it (using the `https` protocol from the `www.example.com` server).

#### üëâ The statement correctly points out that in everyday web programming, most of the URIs you encounter will be URLs.


## üó∫Ô∏è URL & URI in Java Network Programming terms
‚û°Ô∏è In Java network programming, the terms URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) and URL (Uniform Resource Locator) are closely related, yet distinct in their meaning and usage. Here‚Äôs how they differ and interact, particularly with the standard Java classes `java.net.URI` and `java.net.URL`:

**1. Conceptual Difference:**
- **URI** is a generic identifier for any resource, abstract or physical, and can denote a name, a location, or both. It is a broader concept that encompasses both URLs and URNs (Uniform Resource Names).
- **URL** is a specific subset of URI that not only identifies a resource but also provides a means to locate and retrieve it, typically via a network protocol like HTTP, FTP, etc.

**2. Syntax Comparison:**
Both use a similar syntax, but URLs must specify a scheme (protocol) such as `http`, `https`, `ftp`, `file`, etc., to describe access mechanisms, while a URI could use schemes like `urn` or `mailto` that identify resources without specifying access methods.

**3. Java API Differences:**
- **`java.net.URL` Class:**
  - Represents a valid URL only (with supported schemes like http, https, ftp, etc).
  - Implies locatability: Can open a connection to the resource referenced (via methods like `.openConnection()`).
  - Cannot represent URNs or arbitrary URIs without network location.
  - More restrictive, but provides the means to fetch or interact with a resource over a network.

- **`java.net.URI` Class:**
  - Represents any valid URI.
  - Purely syntactic: Does not provide direct access to network resources or resolve resource locations.
  - Can parse and assemble URIs, including those that are not URLs (like `urn:isbn:1234567890`).
  - Provides full control over all URI components (scheme, authority, path, query, fragment).
  - Useful for generic resource identification, manipulation, and validation.

**4. Practical Examples:**

- **URL Creation:**
  ```java
  URL url = new URL("http://example.com/resource");  // Valid URL and URI
  // Cannot create URL for URN or mailto schemes:
  // URL url2 = new URL("urn:isbn:0451450523"); // Throws MalformedURLException
  ```

- **URI Creation:**
  ```java
  URI uri = new URI("urn:isbn:0451450523");  // Valid URI, not a URL
  URI uri2 = new URI("http://example.com/resource");  // Valid URI, also a URL
  ```

- **Converting URI to URL:**
  ```java
  URI uri = new URI("http://example.com/resource");
  URL url = uri.toURL();  // Works for locatable URIs (i.e., URLs only)
  ```

**5. Usage Guidelines:**
- Use **URI** when you need to refer to or manipulate resource identifiers abstractly, without requiring network access.
- Use **URL** when the goal is to locate, fetch, or interact with a resource over a network connection.

**6. üìñ Summary Table**:

| Feature         | URI                     | URL                 |
|-----------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Scope           | Any resource identifier| Location+Access     |
| Java Class      | `java.net.URI`         | `java.net.URL`      |
| Network Access  | Not possible           | Possible            |
| Examples        | `urn:isbn:12345`       | `http://google.com` |

### 4. "The URL class is the simplest way for a Java program to locate and retrieve data... you do not need to worry about the details..."
‚û°Ô∏è This is the most critical part for a Java developer. It describes the `java.net.URL` class as a high-level **abstraction**.

*   **The Hard Way (Without the `URL` class):** To get a file from a server, you would have to manually:
    1.  Parse the URL string to get the protocol (`https`), host (`example.com`), and path (`/index.html`).
    2.  Open a low-level network connection (a `Socket`) to the server on the correct port (e.g., port 443 for HTTPS).
    3.  Manually write the HTTP request headers, like `GET /index.html HTTP/1.1`.
    4.  Read the server's raw response byte by byte.
    5.  Handle redirects, errors, and other complexities of the HTTP protocol.

*   **The Simple Way (With the `URL` class):** The `URL` class hides all that complexity.
    1.  You create a `URL` object: `URL myUrl = new URL("https://example.com/index.html");`
    2.  You call a simple method like `myUrl.openStream()`.
    3.  Java handles all the socket connections, protocol details, and request/response formatting for you. You just get back a stream of data to read.

#### üí≠ **Analogy:** The `URL` class is like a delivery service. You just give it an address (the URL string). You don't need to know how to drive the truck, which route to take, or how the truck's engine works. You just get the package (the data) delivered to your doorstep.
