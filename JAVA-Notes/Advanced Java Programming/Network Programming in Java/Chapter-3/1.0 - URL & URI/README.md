## What is a URL (Uniform Resource Locator)‚ùì
‚û°Ô∏è A **URL** is a specific *type* of URI. Its primary job is not just to identify a resource but also to specify its location and the method (protocol) to access it. It's the web address you type into your browser.

### üî∏ A URL contains information like:
*   **Protocol:** `http://`, `https://`, `ftp://`
*   **Hostname:** `www.github.com`
*   **Path:** `/Manish-Bishwakarma`

#### üí≠ **Analogy:** A URL is like a full home address: `123 Main Street, Anytown, USA`. It gives you the exact location and implies a method to get there (e.g., by road).


## What is a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)‚ùì
‚û°Ô∏è A **URI** is a string of characters used to identify a resource. Think of it as a generic ID for anything. This "resource" can be a physical object, a document, a web page, or even an abstract concept. The key purpose of a URI is to provide a unique and unambiguous identifier.

A URI has two main types:
1.  **Locator (URL):** Tells you where to find something.
2.  **Name (URN):** Just names something uniquely, without telling you its location.

**Analogy:** Think of your name, "Manish Bishwakarma". It's a unique identifier (a URN, or Uniform Resource *Name*). It identifies *you*, but it doesn't tell anyone where to find you. The ISBN of a book (e.g., `urn:isbn:0-486-27557-4`) is another perfect example of a URI that is a name, not a location.

### The Difference in General Terms

The main difference is one of scope: **All URLs are URIs, but not all URIs are URLs.**

*   A **URI** is the overarching concept of identifying something.
*   A **URL** is a more specific kind of URI that also tells you where to find that something.

Let's use an analogy:

| Concept | Analogy | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **URI** | The general idea of "a person's identity" | "Manish Bishwakarma" (identifies you, but where are you?) |
| **URL** | A person's full home address | "Manish Bishwakarma, 123 Code Street, Dev City" (tells us exactly where to find you) |

In the digital world:
*   `https://github.com/Manish-Bishwakarma` is both a **URI** (it identifies your profile) and a **URL** (it tells the browser where to locate it).
*   `urn:isbn:978-0321765723` (the ISBN for a book) is a **URI**, but it is *not* a URL because it only names the book; it doesn't tell you where to download or buy it.
