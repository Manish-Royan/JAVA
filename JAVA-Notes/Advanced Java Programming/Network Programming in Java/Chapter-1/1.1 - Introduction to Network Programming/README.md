# Introduction to Network Programming üñ•Ô∏è

‚û°Ô∏è Network programming is the process of writing software that communicates with other software across a computer network. It enables applications to share data and resources, whether they are running on the same machine or on different machines thousands of miles apart.

‚û°Ô∏è At its core, network programming involves two or more programs (often called a **client** and a **server**) communicating with each other by sending and receiving data packets.

----

### üîç The Core Idea (How communication happens)
‚û°Ô∏è Networking works with two main ends:
1. **Client** ‚Äì the one who requests (like a **web browser**).
2. **Server** ‚Äì the one who responds (like **Google‚Äôs server**).

‚û°Ô∏è They communicate using protocols (rules for communication).
* Common ones:
    * **HTTP/HTTPS** ‚Üí websites
    * **FTP ‚Üí** file transfer
    * **SMTP/IMAP** ‚Üí email
    * **TCP/UDP** ‚Üí general transport

#### üëâ Underneath, all communication happens via Sockets. A socket = a ‚Äúvirtual cable connector‚Äù on each end (Client socket ‚Üî Server socket).

### üîñ Example Flow (Web Page)
‚û°Ô∏è When you open `https://www.example.com`:
1. Your browser (client) resolves the domain ‚Üí gets IP using DNS.
2. Browser opens a **TCP connection (Socket)** to server IP + port 443. (Port 443 is the standard, default port used for HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) traffic on the internet.)
3. Sends an **HTTP request** (like: `GET /index.html`).
4. Server sends back an **HTTP response** (HTML + images).
5. Browser shows the page to you.
#### üëâ That‚Äôs network programming in action ‚Äî but done by the browser for us. With Java, we can build such clients and servers ourself.

## üóùÔ∏è Key Concepts

1.  **Sockets**: A socket is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network. **A socket is bound to a port number** so that the Transport Layer can identify the application that data is destined to be sent to.

2.  **IP Address & Port**:
    *   An **IP address** is a unique identifier for a device on a network (like a street address for a house).
    *   A **port** is a number that identifies a specific application or service on that device (like an apartment number in a building). A port is a numeric endpoint on a host that identifies a service instance. `IP + port = the network ‚Äúphone number‚Äù for a service`. Together, an IP address and port create a unique endpoint for network communication.

3.  **Protocols**: These are the rules that govern how data is transmitted and received. The two most common protocols are:
    *   **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: Provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of bytes. It is a connection-oriented protocol, meaning it establishes a connection before data is sent (like a phone call).
    *   **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**: Provides a much simpler, connectionless service. It sends packets of data called datagrams, but it doesn't guarantee delivery, order, or error-checking. It's faster than TCP and is often used for streaming video, online gaming, and DNS.

4.  **Client-Server Model**: This is the most common architecture in network programming.
    *   The **Server** is a program that waits for and listens for incoming connections from clients.
    *   The **Client** is a program that initiates a connection to a server to request information or services.

### üîñ How It Works: A Simple Example
1.  A server application starts running on a computer. It binds to a specific port (e.g., **port 80 for a web server**) and **waits for a client to connect**.
2.  **A client application on another computer knows the server's IP address and the port it's listening on**.
3.  **The client creates a socket and initiates a connection to the server's IP address and port**.
4.  If the server accepts the connection, a communication channel is established.
5.  The client and server can now send and receive data (like web page requests and responses) through their sockets.
6.  Once the communication is complete, the connection is closed.

## Why do we need Network Programming‚ùì
* To make applications talk to each other (client-server communication).
* To share resources (files, databases, printers, etc.).
* To build real-world applications like:
    - Web browsers (HTTP requests).
    - Email clients (SMTP/IMAP).
    - Online games (real-time networking).
    - Cloud applications (REST/gRPC).
* Without networking, programs are stuck on one machine. Networking makes them global üåç.

## üó®Ô∏è Types of Network Communication 

‚û°Ô∏è The main difference between them is **how many devices receive a message from a single sender** and how efficiently this is done.

### üî∏Unicast (1-to-1) üìû

‚Ü≥ Unicast is a **one-to-one** conversation. It's the most common type of network communication. When you send data, it's addressed to a single, specific destination.

* **Analogy:** A **private phone call** or sending a letter to a specific mailing address. The message is intended for only one recipient, and the postal service (the network) ensures it gets delivered directly to them.

* **How it works:** Every device on a network has a unique IP address. A unicast packet contains the specific destination IP address of the single device it's meant for. Switches and routers in the network look at this address and forward the packet along the most direct path to that one recipient.

* **Common Examples:**
    * **Browsing a website:** Your computer (the client) sends a unicast request to the website's server, and the server sends the webpage back in a unicast transmission directly to your computer.
    * **Sending an email:** Your email client connects directly to your mail server.
    * **Downloading a file:** You establish a direct one-to-one connection with the server holding the file.

### üî∏Broadcast (1-to-all) üì¢

‚Ü≥ Broadcast is a **one-to-all** message. A single device sends a packet that every other device on the **same local network segment** receives and processes, whether they need it or not.

* **Analogy:** **Shouting in a crowded room.** Everyone in the room hears you, even if you were only hoping one person would answer. It's effective for getting everyone's attention but can be disruptive.

* **How it works:** Packets are sent to a special broadcast address (like `255.255.255.255`). Network devices are programmed to listen for and process any packet sent to this address. Importantly, **routers typically do not forward broadcast traffic** to other networks to prevent it from flooding the entire internet (this is called a "broadcast storm").

* **Common Examples:**
    * **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):** When your computer joins a network, it knows the router's IP address but not its physical (MAC) address. It sends a broadcast to the entire local network asking, "Who has the IP address 192.168.1.1?" Every device hears it, but only the router replies.
    * **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):** When you first connect to a Wi-Fi network, your device sends a broadcast message saying, "I'm new here! Can anyone assign me an IP address?" The DHCP server on the network hears this and responds.

### üî∏Multicast (1-to-group) üì∫
‚Ü≥ Multicast is a **one-to-a-group** communication, acting as a middle ground between unicast and broadcast. A sender sends a single stream of data, and it's delivered simultaneously to multiple, specific recipients who have opted-in to receive it.

* **Analogy:** A **magazine subscription** or a TV channel. The publisher sends out one magazine, and the delivery service makes copies *only* for those who have subscribed. People who haven't subscribed are not bothered. This is much more efficient than the publisher sending a separate, individual copy to every single subscriber (unicast) or sending a copy to every single house in the country (broadcast).

* **How it works:** Multicast uses a special range of IP addresses (Class D: `224.0.0.0` to `239.255.255.255`). Devices that want to receive the data "subscribe" to a specific multicast group address. The network infrastructure is smart enough to replicate the packet and send it only down the paths that lead to subscribed members. This saves immense bandwidth.

* **Common Examples:**
    * **IPTV / Live Video Streaming:** When thousands of people watch a live football game online, the provider sends out a single multicast stream. The network duplicates the stream only where necessary to reach all the viewers. This is far better than sending thousands of individual unicast streams.
    * **Stock Market Data:** A server sends out real-time stock quotes to a multicast group. Only the computers of financial traders who have subscribed to that feed receive the data.
    * **Online Gaming:** Game servers can send updates (like a player's position) to a multicast group consisting of all players in that specific match.
