# Data Type in JAVA

Java data types define the type and value range of the data for the different types of variables, constants, method parameters, return types, etc. The data type tells the compiler about the type of data to be stored and the required memory. To store and manipulate different types of data, all variables must have specified data types.

Based on the data type of a variable, the operating system allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory. Therefore, by assigning different data types to variables, you can store integers, decimals, or characters in these variables.
