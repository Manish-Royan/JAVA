# JDK, JRE, and JVM

JDK, JRE, and JVM are the most important parts of the Java programming language. Without these, you can not develop and run java programs on your machine.

* **JDK**: JDK stands for Java Development Kit. JDK provides an environment to develop and execute the java program. JDK is a kit that includes two things - `Development Tools` to provide an environment to develop your java programs and `JRE` to execute your Java programs.

* **JRE**: JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment. JRE provides an environment to only run (not develop) the java programs onto your machine. JRE is only used by the end-users of the system. JRE consists of libraries and other files that JVM uses at runtime.

* **JVM**: JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine, which is a very important part of both JDK and JRE because it is inbuilt in both. Whatever java program run using JDK and JRE goes into the JVM and **JVM is responsible for executing the java program line by line**.
