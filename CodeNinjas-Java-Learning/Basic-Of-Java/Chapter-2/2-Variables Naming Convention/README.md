# Variables naming Convention in Java

    • A variable name should be short and meaningful.
    [Example: instead `int number` → use `int num`, which is short and meaningful.]

    • It should begin with a lowercase letter.
    [Example:  instead `int Num` → use `int num`]

    • It can begin with special characters such as _ (underscore) and $ (dollar) sign.
    [Example: `int _num`, `int $num`]

    • If the variable name contains multiple words, then use the camel case, (i.e. variable name should start with a lowercase letter followed by an uppercase letter). 
    [Example: `int camleCase`, `int codeNinjas`]

    • Always try to avoid single character variable names such as 'i', 'j', and 'k' except for the temporary variables.
    [Example: `int a`, `int b`]

    • A variable name can not contain whitespaces.
    [Example: `int nu mber` → it is invalid]

    • We can’t use keywords(pre-defined literals) as the variable names.
    [Example: `int int`, `int static`]
