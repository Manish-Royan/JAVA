# Introduction and Declaration of Variables


## Introduction to Variables

A Variable is a name given to a memory location. It is used to store a value that may vary. **Java is a statically typed language**, and hence, *all the variables are declared before use*.  

### Variable Declaration

In Java, we can declare variables as follows:

    • type: Type of the data that can be stored in this variable. It can be int, float, double, etc.
    • name: Name given to the variable.
    • data_type variable_name;

Example: `int x;`

In this way, we can only create a variable in the memory location. Currently, it doesn’t have any value. We can assign the value in this variable by using two ways:

    • By using variable initialization.
    
        Syntax: data_type variable_name = value;
        Example: int x = 10;

    • By taking input (Using Scanner Class).
